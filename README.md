# JC — Simple Real Estate Landing Page

This is a single-page site for **Joshua Cantres** (JC — The People’s Realtor).

## Quick Edit
Open `index.html` and update any copy. Colors use Tailwind (red/black/white).

## Contact Form (Formspree)
1. Create a form at https://formspree.io (free tier is fine).
2. Copy your form ID and paste it into `FORMSPREE_ID` inside `index.html`.
3. Deploy. Submissions will go to your email dashboard.

If `FORMSPREE_ID` is empty, the form falls back to an email draft to `joshuacantres.hsc@gmail.com`.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public), e.g., `jc-landing`.
2. Upload `index.html` to the root of the repo (or drag-drop in the web UI).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`, choose branch `main` (or `master`) and folder `/ (root)`.
4. Save. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` shortly.

## Local Preview
Just double-click `index.html` to open in your browser.
